"""
01_tools_with_model.py - Basic Tool Definition and Binding

This example demonstrates:
✅ Creating tools with the @tool decorator
✅ Using function docstrings as tool descriptions
✅ Type hints for automatic schema generation
✅ Binding tools to a language model
✅ Invoking the model to call tools
✅ Extracting tool calls from model responses

Prerequisites:
- Ollama running locally (ollama serve)
- ollama pull qwen3.5:latest (or gemma4:latest)

Message Flow:
1. HumanMessage: User asks a question
2. AIMessage: Model recognizes need to call a tool
3. ToolMessage: Tool result is returned (handled internally)
4. AIMessage: Model provides final response
