04_model_toolcalling.py - Tool Binding & Function Calling (Model-Side)

This example demonstrates:
1. Creating tools with @tool decorator
2. Binding tools to models with bind_tools()
3. Extracting tool calls from model responses
4. Analyzing tool call arguments

Key Concepts:
  - Tool: A function the model can call (not executed by default)
  - bind_tools(): Makes model aware of available tools
  - tool_calls: Array of tool calls the model decided to make
  - This is Step 1 of a 3-step tool calling workflow

Three-Step Tool Calling Pattern:
  1. Model decides to call a tool → returns tool_calls
  2. Execute the tool with provided arguments
  3. Return results to model for final response

Use bind_tools() for:
  - Agents that need external functions
  - Planning tasks before execution
  - Multi-step workflows
  - Autonomous systems
