02_model_stream.py - Streaming Model Responses

This example demonstrates:
1. Streaming responses token-by-token
2. Real-time display of model output
3. Flushing output immediately for live feedback
4. Better UX for long-form responses

Key Difference from invoke():
  - invoke(): Wait for complete response (blocking)
  - stream(): Get tokens as they're generated (streaming)

Use stream() when:
  - User expects immediate feedback
  - Response is long (articles, code, etc.)
  - Building real-time chatbot UIs
  - Network latency is a concern

    # end="|" shows token boundaries
    # flush=True sends output immediately instead of buffering
